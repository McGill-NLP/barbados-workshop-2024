            <p>
                Artificial intelligence in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs) has advanced more rapidly than most researchers expected. As a result, estimates of how long it will take to develop human-level AI have shortened,
                accelerating speculation about the long-term dangers of AI. Far future predictions are valuable, but it is at least as important to engage with the concrete risks AI poses now. Especially since our capacity to solve
                long-term dangers will be determined by immediate risks: effective alignment algorithms must at least work for the easy cases we encounter at present. And, to make good collective decisions for the future, we must ensure
                that short-term proliferation of AI technologies does not irrevocably harm our economies and societies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The objective of this workshop is to make progress on foreseeable and quantifiable risks of AI on the five year time scale. We will convene experts from diverse domains such as natural language processing, machine learning,
                safety, privacy, and law within a singular forum to understand the concrete, demonstrable risks of LLMs. Together, will examine strategies for mitigating these risks and pinpoint areas that need further exploration and
                development. Foremost, we seek to ground the discourse around LLM risks in a pragmatic and actionable framework.

                <li>The coffee there is of the instant variety. If you wish to bring your own coffee you may do so.</li>
                <li>
                    Vegetarians may want to bring their favorite non-perishables, however it is not necessary since there is already a diverse selection at the local supermarket. There is also good vegetarian roti in several places near
                    Bellairs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beach, Sun, Snorkeling, and SCUBA diving</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bellairs is situated on one of the best beaches in Barbados, so don't forget your bathing suit (and skin protection) for swims before breakfast and in between work sessions.</li>
                <li>
                    There is also good snorkeling right in front of Bellairs so if you have a mask and fins bring them along too. In fact, if you SCUBA dive bring your gear. There is diving right there as well and air tanks at Bellairs cost
                    only about US$12.00 per tank!
